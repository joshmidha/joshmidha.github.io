## Veritas: Injections of Honesty

We provide online community interventions **(OCIs)**. Veritas responds to echo chambers and opinion terrorism. 

Veritas scans twitter for sparks in sentiment within certain topics, imbalanced strong-weak ratios within structure, and connectivity bubbles within conversations. 

We then study the community, noting patterns, behaviors and activity peaks. As per that we provide a behavioral intervention, in the form of evidence-based Tweets, as a neutralizer to this polarization. Our Tweets are released through users who support the movement. As such we aim to crowd source action from those frustrated with the state of online platforms. 

Our interventions are carefully layed out, organized, deployed. This is online protest. 

Counts as of December 27, 2022:
- Tweets: 122
- Users Affected: 5424
- Chambers: 13
